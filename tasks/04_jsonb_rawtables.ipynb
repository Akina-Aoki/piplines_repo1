    "- Data comes from APIs\n",
    "- Fields may change over time\n",
    "- Some records have extra or missing attributes\n",
    "- You want fast ingestion with minimal transformation\n",

    "- One job has salary_range\n",
    "- Another has hourly_rate\n",

    "Raw tables are a core ETL design pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A raw table stores data:\n",
    "- Exactly as received\n",
    "- With minimal or no transformation\n",

    "#### Why raw tables exist\n",
    "1️⃣ Safety\n",
    "If a transformation fails: ,you can reprocess from raw and don’t need to re-fetch data\n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ Auditability\n",
    "This is critical for:\n",
    "- Debugging\n",
    "- Compliance\n",
    "- Trust in data\n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ Schema evolution\n",
    "When APIs change:\n",
    "- Raw tables still load\n",
    "- Downstream models can adapt later"
